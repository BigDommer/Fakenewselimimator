My Engineering Project Senior Year
I had to make a website with Software Engineering for Engineering Design & Development. This was because we had to come up with a solution for dealing with fake news or slanted news online. The way we did this was through make a Rotten Tomatoes type website where people could rate news sites letting you know if this news site is trustworthy or not.
